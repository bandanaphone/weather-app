Weather App v1.2

This update to my weather app contains forecast information, as well as a placeholder for if I ever decide to add time features to it. 

This Weather App was built to run in a Desktop environment. So you don't need to install any dependencies to run it. You will, however, need to acquire an API key from <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Maps</a> to get started. Acquiring an API key is free and easy. Expect your API key to work within a few hours after registration.
