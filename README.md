Weather App v1.2

This update to my weather app contains forecast information, as well as a placeholder for if I ever decide to add time features to it.

Weather App v1.2 was built using ReactJS and the Electron environment.

This Weather App was built to run on the desktop. So you don't need to install any dependencies to run it. You will, however, need to acquire an API key from <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Maps</a> to get started. Acquiring an API key is free and easy. Expect your API key to work within a few hours after registration.
